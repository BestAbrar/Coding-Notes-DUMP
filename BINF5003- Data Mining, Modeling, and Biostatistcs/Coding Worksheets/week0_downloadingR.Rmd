## Welcome to BINF 5003: Data Mining, Modeling, and Biostatistics!

This course is a hands-on exploration of R and RStudio. If you have any
issues preparing your computer, I want to resolve them in advance so
that you can make the most of our time together. As you follow these
instructions, don't worry if you don't understand exactly what is going
on because we will go through it all again during the first tutorial.
The purpose here is to ensure that your computer is set up and ready for
action. If you can't complete these steps, I need to work with you
before the workshop to get you ready.

### Tech Requirements

Before we start, you will require your own laptop computer, with the
following minimum requirements: 1024×768 screen resolution, 1.5GHz CPU,
2GB RAM, 10GB free disk space, recent versions of Windows, Mac OS X or
Linux (most computers purchased in the past 3-4 years likely meet these
requirements).

Make sure you have a robust internet browser such as Firefox, Safari or
Chrome (not Internet Explorer).

Make sure you have a PDF viewer (e.g., Adobe Acrobat, Preview or
similar), or that you can read PDF files in your Web browser.

### Download R

1. Download R, a free software environment for statistical computing and
graphics from [CRAN](https://cloud.r-project.org/), the Comprehensive R
Archive Network. I highly recommend you install a precompiled binary
distribution for your operating system -- use the links up at the top of
the CRAN page!

Note: MacBook users with an Apple Silicon chip (e.g., M1 or M2) should
install the "arm64" version of R, while MacBook users with an Intel chip
should install the regular (64-bit) version of R. You can check your
laptop's hardware specifications by clicking the Apple icon (top left
corner) \> About This Mac and verifying whether the chip is Apple or
Intel

2. Install [RStudio's IDE](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
(stands for integrated development environment), a powerful user
interface for R. Click the link under "2: Install RStudio". RStudio
comes with a text editor, so there is no immediate need to install a
separate stand-alone editor.

3. If R is already installed, ensure that the R version is at least 4.0 or
higher. You can do this by opening RStudio, where you should see a
multi-section window like below. We'll take a tour of the interface
together. For now, locate the quadrant named "Console" as indicated by
the red square in the image below.

4. Put your cursor at the start of the prompt indicated by the `>` symbol
and where the red arrow is pointing. Type or copy `sessionInfo()` - make
sure that only the I at the start of Info is capitalized and you are
including the round brackets. Press enter to run this command and R
should return an output to you. Then, double check your R version in the
first line. Ensure that the R version is at least 4.0 or higher. If you
have an older version of R like this image, you can re-install a more
current version R (do not need to re-install RStudio).

### TinyTex

There is one package we have to install first before we can create PDF
reports, which will be necessary for assignments and the project. Copy
and paste into the console (where the `>` symbol is) the two lines of
code below to install a package called `tinytex`.

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages('tinytex') 
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

### All packages

Next, let's install all the packages that we will be using in the course
(more on what packages are soon!). Follow the steps below.

1.  First, we will be installing packages from the Comprehensive R
    Archive Network (CRAN). To install these packages, you can copy the
    code below and paste it into your console.

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "gridExtra", "cowplot", "datasauRus", "tidyselect"),
                 dependencies = TRUE)
```

2.  Next, we'll be using packages hosted on a different repository.
    Again, copy and paste the code into your console. These will take a
    while to download and depend on your internet speed. Budget at least
    30-60 mins. The installs will likely also require your input so keep
    an eye on the console.

```{r eval = FALSE}
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install("GEOquery")
BiocManager::install("oligo")
BiocManager::install("limma")
BiocManager::install("hgu133a.db")
BiocManager::install("Biobase")
```
\newpage

During installation, if you ever get the below message about updating loaded packages, select "No".

![Click "No".](figures/restartr.png){width=25%}

And if you get this message in your console "Do you want to install from
sources the packages which need compilation? (Yes/no/cancel)", type
"Yes" in the console.

To check that these packages have been installed correctly, go to the
bottom right pane and click the tab for "Packages". If you can search
for and find the below packages, then they have been installed! They do
not need to be checked off.

Packages

-   tidyverse
-   gridExtra
-   cowplot
-   datasauRus
-   tidyselect
-   ggfortify
-   BiocManager
