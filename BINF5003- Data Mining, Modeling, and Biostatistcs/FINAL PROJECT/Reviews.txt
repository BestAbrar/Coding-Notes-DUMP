Group 1 (Alexandria)
I like the research question ,and the line graph showing average screen time versus mental health index between type of work was a very surprising figure, I think the findings were also surprising, wouldn’t have expected that work-type and stress would have less effect than screen time
Group 2  (Noora, Asma, Tori, Jihyun)
I think it’s more surprising that the dataset didn’t show a correlation between hours studied and their GPA, was there a concern over the quality of the data set? Overall I think this topic could definitely be revisited with different data collection methods as you had suggested.
Group 3 (Nicole)
Very cool study, mitosis being the most sensitive for cancer treatments makes a lot of sense
Group 4 (Maya)
I’ve never heard of a dataset being supplemented by algorithmic methods before, could it have an influence with exaggerating trends and the noise seen in your findings?
Group 5 (Gizem Esra Genc)
I think making a predictor model based on a dataset was very cool
Group 6 (David, Yinglan)
This topic is very near to my heart, I appreciate your thorough investigation to the detail you have gone through
Group 7 (Robert)
Great presentation, I wish F1 had less strict rule sets and went back to true-form, kinda was expecting pole position have a strong correlation when everything is standardized
Group 10 (Lauren)
I think it’s interesting that potassium and fiber was high in nuts, I like the idea of using PCAs for the individual nutrient types and
Group 11 (Kerry, Morsal, Raed)
Was there an explanation for the trends seen with the run-time of the movie versus time, why was there a plateau in runtime for more recent films
Group 12 (Alize)
I really like the figures and the layout of your presentation, it’s very aesthetically pleasing. 
Group 13 (Rohan)
Great explanation of LASSO for filtering data, it’s an interesting approach that I wasn’t aware of before
Group 14 (Navpreet)
Great job contrasting the statistical models to handle highly skewed data, I think it was very well done
Group 15 (Sadaf)
Great presentation, I hope this topic can be revisited using data that isn’t self-reported as it seems to tend to give strange findings, perhaps BMI and poor diet have a stronger correlation on OSVP than first thought
Group 16 (Oxana)
Good presentation, I’m not surprised that companies that take less risky behaviour are also the ones that perform the best.
Group 17 (Dhra)
Diabetes factors makes sense, I don’t know if I missed it but I think it would be a great idea to also look at population demographics as well.
Group 18 (Rabindra)
Great presentation, not surprisingly elderly have the most negative to complain about hospital wait times
Group 19 (Tija)
AML and ALL is definitely an important topic, I like the visualization of showing the statistical differences between the two Leukemia.
Group 20 (Joud)
I think the most shocking part of this presentation is that my honey might possibly not be honey, great presentation overall, I like the great case you made to show the correlation (or lack there of) between honey bees and insecticides
